1. getting the Material library dependency
    import Glide library

2. making layout: activity_main

3. now for the all Trainings Activity,
    we first need the Training model creating that: Training.java

4. creating TrainingRecViewAdapter
    for that we also need layout: training_item.xml, making that

5. making TrainingRecViewAdapter

6. making AllTrainingsActivity
        the layout file: activity_all_trainings.xml: put only the RecyclerView

        also we need Utils class, and inside that the allTrainings ArrayList
        and method to get that AL, make it in Utils class

7. permission for internet in: androidManifest file

8. now when we click one of the Training, we need to open the the TrainingActivity
   so making TrainingActivity

9. but to open that Training on which the user has clicked, we have to puExtra that Training
   with the Intent coming from TrainingRecViewAdapter class

        now to putExtra, we can't Directly put Training inside the Intent,
        we have to put it as a Parcelable
        and to do so
        we need to implement Parcelable and it's methods and creator fields inside the
        Training.java (POJO class)

    now we can put the Training object into the intent as a Parcelable, and the Key will be
    TRAINING_KEY, which we have defined in the TrainingActivity.java

10. Making Plan model

11. in the MainActivity, setting onClickListener for btnMyPlans
        but for this we want to make AllPlansActivity,making it now
        so making of activity_all_plans.xml
        we also need, plan_items.xml, making that

12. in Utils, making Plans AL, and getPlans method

13. now from the intent of AllPlansActivity we reach to AllTrainingActivity
    and from AllTrainingActivity when we click on a Training
    (then from the logic defined in the TrainingsRecViewAdapter, we reach to TrainingActivity
    and there we have the button, btnAddPlan
    as soon as we click that button we have to open a dialog,
    which will show training name, and ask for minutes and day for which we want to practice

    so for this dialog, we made
        dialog_plan_details
        now we make it's java file: Plan_Details_dialog.java

14. so what in total we are doing here:

    mission 1: we want to get the clicked training from AllTrainingsActivity
            then we want to send that Training with the intent from AllTrainingActivity to TrainingActivity

            inside the Training Activity
            what we want to do is, get the Training which has come from AllTraining,
            then showing a dialog to user to ask the day and minutes: (this is defined in dialog_plan_details.xml)
            and now we have the clicked Training, day, and minutes

            now we would make plan out of it:
            as to make a new plan we have to pass following arguments inside it's constructor:
                Training, day, minutes, isAccomplished
            so we pass these, and make a plan

            now we make a callback interface inside the PlanDialogInterface.java to pass this plan
            back to it's parent activity i.e the TrainingActivity

            now implement the PassPlanInterface in the TrainingActivity
            and in implementing the method of passPlanInterface object
            i.e the getPlan() method

            we get the Plan object from PlanDetailsDialog

            and now if that plan is not noll, we try to add it to static allPlans AL
            which is inside the Utils class, we do so  with the help of
            addPlan() method of Utils class

            and then we startActivity,to go from this TrainingActivity to AllPlansActivity
            but to show AllPlansActivity,
            we have to make a PlansRecViewAdapter, plan_item.xml etc files
            to set the adapter and plans, in the havePlansRecView

making PlanRecViewAdapter

so in AllActivity, we have a recyclerView: this recyclerView is day recyclerView
so it will show the days with name
and this recycler view also will have a RecyclerView inside them,
so that inner recyclerView will show all the Plans we have for that day

so for the external RecView: i.e to show the days, we make day_item.xml
and we will have DayRecViewAdapter
